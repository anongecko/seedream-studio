This is a NextJS project I made for personal use to use up the free API credits that you get when signing up at Bytedance for Seedream 4, and recently Seedream 4.5. It's pretty unnecessary, but feel free to join the party if you have an API key and don't want to generate images through your terminal.

## Privacy
I don't really care what you generate, so anything stored is within your browser. If you generate a masterpiece that includes a BTC wallet private key that contains $450B, it's still gone. 

## Features
- Supports all forms of generation and all features of both Seedream 4 and Seedream 4.5 (except streaming because..why?)
- Toggle between Seedream 4 (basically has never heard word "censorship") and Seedream 4.5 (slightly censored) at will
- Easily visualize and select from any of Seedream's available aspect ratios/resolutions
- CHoose between Normal and Fast generation
- Bulk uploads for reference images and bulk downloads of outputs
- Ability to enable batch generation on any tab and set an image output limit

## Usage
1. Recommended:
Just go to the link included in this repo (https://dream.tits.li), enter your API get, and generate to your heart's content (or API key limit).

2. This is a Next.js project that uses pnpm. Clone the repo, cd into its directory, `pnpm install` (accept the scripts), `pnpm dev`, access on your localhost:3000.
